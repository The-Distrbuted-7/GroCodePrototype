When you upload this code it will probably not work. Intellij will complain that two modules is missing.
I did refresh gradel project and added a local.properties tex edeting document to the projects root foolder,
with this in side it:

sdk.dir=/Users/johanringstrom/Library/Android/sdk

change it to your path. This is ofcaurse not a good way of dooing it. Better ideas will be appreciated.
